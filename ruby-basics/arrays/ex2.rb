pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard']

# Write some code that selects 'fish' and 'lizard' from the pets array - select the two items at the same time. Assign the return value to a variable named my_pets, then print the contents of my_pets as a single string, e.g.:

# creates an array of those values
my_pets = pets[2..3]

p my_pets

puts "I have a pet #{my_pets[0]} and a pet #{my_pets[1]}"
